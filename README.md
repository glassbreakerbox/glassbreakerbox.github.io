# GlassBreakerBox website

This website is generated by [jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) and hosted on
[github pages](https://pages.github.com/).

The folder `_posts` contains the text which is embedded after the header. The
text is written in markdown (see above) and they should contain an image
(optional) and whatever we like. Mock content has been added for a demo.

`_includes/about.html` has to be modified with a general description of our 
product and maybe a video demonstration can be embedded.
