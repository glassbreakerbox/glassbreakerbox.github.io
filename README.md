# GlassBreakerBox website

This website is generated by [jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) and hosted on
[github pages](https://pages.github.com/).

The folder `_posts` contains the text which is embedded after the header. The
text is written in markdown (see above) and they should contain an image
(optional) and whatever we like. Mock content has been added for a demo.

`_includes/about.html` has to be modified with a general description of our 
product and maybe a video demonstration can be embedded.

## Building and trying the webpage

Jekyll has to be installed on your PC, see the link above for instructions on
how to install it. Basically you need to have ruby and gem installed before
proceding.

After you have modified something run the command `jekyll build`.

To try the webpage locally run `jekyll serve`.

If you are satisfied with your modifications commit and push the changes to the
repository.
